          <h1>QuickBooks Point of Sale</h1>

          </div>

            <div class="text-2">

            <div>

            <img class="hero-image" src="images/POS.jpg" alt="QuickBooks POS">

            </div>

            <p align="justify"><img style="float:right;" src="images/QB-POS-box-0.png" alt="QuickBooks POS">QuickBooks Point of Sale is probably the easiest   of all the QuickBooks products to use. However, it is the most challenging to   set up. If not set up properly there will be errors that can NEVER be corrected.   Yes, they can be corrected going forward but the sales that were done   incorrectly in the past usually cannot be fixed.</p>

            <p align="justify">When you are opening a new retail store, or when   you have purchased an existing store, you are making a substantial investment in   everything from build-out to fixtures to inventory. You will have a lot of   concerns on your mind. Having a POS system that is set up properly from the very   beginning will help make your store easier to run.</p>

            <p align="justify">Marilyn had 15 years of retail management   experience before she became a CPA. So she truly understands, more than most   QuickBooks ProAdvisors, what goes on behind the counter. She even installed a   POS system in the store she managed in the 1980s. Yes, it ran on DOS, which she   now refers to as Dinosaur Operating System.</p>

            <p align="justify">She has worked on well over 250 installations.   Many of these were original installations that she did herself. However, a great   number were situations where she had to fix an incorrect set up. </p>

            <p align="justify">Read some   stories at the end of the page. </p>

            <p align="justify">Many of the issues relate to how the sales   tax was set up in the Point of Sale. Most people do not understand how sales tax   is supposed to work in POS. Because Marilyn is a CPA and has been a retailer,   she understands how it should work and will set it up properly.</p>

            <p align="justify">Marilyn has served on the Intuit Solution Provider   Advisory Council. The Intuit Solution Provider group primarily works with   QuickBooks Point of Sale and QuickBooks Enterprise. However Marilyn has been   working with all QuickBooks products since 1995. She also has co-authored the   QuickBooks Point of Sale version 10.0, 6.0 and 4.0 training materials for other QuickBooks   ProAdvisors who wish to become certified in POS.</p>

            

            <h2>Customer QuickBooks Point of Sale Stories:</h2>

            <p align="justify">1. A POS advisor in Pennsylvania was exhibiting QB   POS at a trade show. When people stopped at his booth to discuss QuickBooks he   found out something very interesting. 100% of the people who set it up   themselves or had it set up by someone who was not very knowledgeable &ldquo;hated   it,&rdquo; &ldquo;wanted to throw it in the ditch,&rdquo; or &lsquo;wanted to throw it in the trash.&rdquo;   100% of the people who had a knowledgeable ISP or POS Certified ProAdvisor set   it up &ldquo;loved it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p align="justify">2. The POS system for a store had been set up   incorrectly a number of years ago. They needed to have their books in order   because they wanted to sell the business. The estimate to review and correct the   errors was anywhere from $8,000.00 to $15,000.00. They needed to hire a   specialized audit company to do this work.</p>

            <p align="justify">3. Marilyn had set up the POS in a brand new   store. Their bookkeeper came in after a month and changed the sales tax to a   method that did not work in Colorado. One side effect is that the new method   generated a lot more work for the bookkeeper. But there was no reason to redo   the sales tax.</p>

            <p align="justify">4. A very well-meaning board member set up a POS   for a non-profit&rsquo;s thrift store. But he/she missed a very important step. As a   result the non-profit lost all their credit card sales from December through   March when they called Marilyn to see why they were not getting bank deposits   for their credit card transactions.</p>
